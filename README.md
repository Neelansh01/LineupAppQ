# LineupAppQ | Basic File Submission Page


## USE CASES:
Create an application to provide an interface for users for selecting files which will be uploaded to a SQL database.


## Tool Stack:
1. **Python-Web Development**: Used Flask and python libraries are used to create the APIs and the backend. Backend code can be written in python easily with minimum code length which makes even the big projects easy to maintain. Python has all the features integrated in backend to implement a secure and fully functional backend using APIs. Python provides an additional advantage over most of the language for it is very easy to be integrated to any existing system be it automation systems, Machine Learning or Data maintenance systems or for testing and sustenance.
2. **SQL Database**: Although other databases could have been used which would facilitate easier data storage in our use case, but we went to implement the data storage in SQL server. We used the **XAMPP** software to host the SQL server and **Apache** interface to view the data refresh in the DB.
